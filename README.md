# Capture One Scripts

Feel free to add these to your C1 scripts menu, or send a pull request if I'm doing something badly (first time using Applescript).

## All Collections to Folder Structure

Exports out your entire C1 user collections structure to disk. I use this to kick lower-res proofs of my variants to my dropbox while retaining my C1 groups, subgroups, and albums.

If you have a lot of photos, *this will take a long time*.

Configure your base directory and your preferred process recipe name in the first few lines of the script.

## Selected Collections to Folder Structure

Similar functionality as the above, but scoped to only the selected collection.

Once again, configure base directory and process recipe in the script.
